# Hi ! I am Manaswini Voolapalli ðŸ‘‹

I am at the beginner level of becoming a full-stack developer. Currently into building projects starting from beginner level and taking them to the advanced level.
Also, have a keen interest in blockchain development and want to become one in near future.

I always believe in the quote:

I always strive to build projects which explains, each and every concept to you in the best possible way, and will continue to do the same. New technology excites me the
most and makes to crave for it by adding it to my projects, one of the instance is the OV.Seva project, which is still under progress. Thus, overall to sum up, my aim is 
to become a great full-stack developer, along with a tech-savy.
